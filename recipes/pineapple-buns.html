                    <li>Cover the bowl with a damp cheese cloth or saran wrap and let set for 1 hour or till the dough grow 1 1/2 times its orginal size*.</li>
                    <li>Lightly flour your working surface. Dump dough out and knead dough till smooth again. Cut into 12 pieces. Form into balls and place on a parchment lined baking sheet, or dont. Let rise for 1 hour.</li>
                    <li>During that hour, make the topping. Grind up 2/3 cup sugar until fine. Put the sugar and 1/4 cup milk powder in a bowl mix and make sure there are no lumps.</li>

                <h4>Notes</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>*A mix of bread flour and cake flour is best but all-purpose works fine.</li>
                    <li>If it's too cold to proof properly, boil some water in a bowl put it in the bottom rack of the oven and place the bowl with the dough directly above it. You may need to change the water a few times during the course of in hour.</li>
